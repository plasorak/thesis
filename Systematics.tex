In this chapter, the systematic uncertainties relevant for neutrino
induced single photon production are detailed.

The systematic uncertainties are divided according to their
sources. Similarly to most of the \Gls{ND} cross section analysis,
they reduce to flux (Section~\ref{sec:fluxsyst}), cross section
(Section~\ref{sec:xsecsyst}) and detector (Section~\ref{sec:detsyst})
systematic errors. Additionally, the statistical uncertainty and the
efficiency uncertainty are also taken into account.

However, given the scale of the contamination of events that happened
outside the Fiducial Volume (\Gls{OOFV}) of the \Gls{FGD}1 and the
expected differences which arise for the systematic uncertainty when
considering neutrino interaction happening in the \Gls{FGD}1 and the
rest of the detector, the two backgrounds systematic uncertainties are
independently motivated.

Finally, all the systematic uncertainties are combined and summarised
in Section \ref{sec:totaluncertainty}.
